    // In the literature, a directed hyperpath between nodes a and b is a sequence of
    //  directed hyperedges where the intersection beteeen the RHS and LHS of subsequent
    //  hyperedges are nonempty, a is in the LHS of the first hyperpath, and b is in the
    //  RHS of the last hyperpath.

    // While useful, this is not a good notion for loan expiry since it is possible
    //  for a hyperpath to consume some vertex twice: for example
    //              ({x, y} -> {z}), ({x, z} -> {w})
    // is a valid hyperpath between x and w, but is nonsensical as a sequence of
    //  loan expiries. More or less, this is what is implemented in the current
    //  reborrowing DAG code (caveat: this is not a soundess bug in the current implementation,
    //  since it only implements a subclass of hypergraphs:
    //     - The LHS and RHS of loans are tagged MIR places with the same number of projections
    //     - All other hyperedges have |LHS| = |RHS| = 1.
    // This is a fine representation, but is insufficient to represent general coupled
    //  loans, including coupled magic wands).

    // A K-path X->Y in a hypergraph K is a DAG of directed hyperedges, where
    //  - the LHS of each edge in the K-path is contained in the union of RHS's and X
    //  - the RHS of each edge is contained in the union of the LHS's and Y
    //  - For each x in X, y in Y, the K-path contains a hyperpath from x to y

    // For example, in some (sufficiently populated) hypergraph K, the subgraph
    //  {a} -> {b,c,g}
    //  {b,c} -> {e}
    //  {b,c} -> {f}
    // is a K-path {a}->{e,f,g}. It is not a K-path {a,z} -> {e,f,g}, since that violates
    //  the third condition

    // A linear K-path X->Y is a DAG {Ai->Bi}  where {X} disjoint union {Ai}
    //  and {Y} disjoint union {Bi} are equal. The above example is not a linear
    //  K-path.

//  The CondInitAnalysis computes an elaborated version of MaybeInitAnalysis,
//   where each maybe initialized place tracks it's possible initialization sites.
//
//  This information is used in kill elaboration. When a place needs to be killed,
//   we insert a flag (enum, usize) which is updated every time the place is
//   re-initalized.
//
//  PROPERTY: All DefinitelyInitialized places will be CondInitialized.
//
//  PROPERTY: All CondInitialized places with one tag are definitelyInitialized
//
//  PROPERTY: A place is definitely not initialzied exactly when it's not
//   CondInitialzied
//
//
//  Fold/Unfold approximation for kill's:
//
//  1. Partial kills and reassignment:
//  When part of a place is killed, we exchange it into all it's subplaces and give them the same
//  initialization time as their full place. It's as if the entire place was initialized in
//  individual projections each time.
//
// 2. When a full place is killed, we must remove all possible subplaces too (handle open drops)
//
// This approximation is sound for code without borrows.
// The conditional code can be used to conditionally apply wands etc later.
// The approximation is inefficient when we move out a field and then move it back in.
